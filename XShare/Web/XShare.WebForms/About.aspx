    <h3>What is Carsharing?</h3>
    <p>Carsharing is smart: you get to use a car without owning one. That’s what we’re all about: making life greener and more affordable for all of us.</p>
    <p>Using our services you will contribute hugely in reducing the amount of CO2 in our atmosphere. People drive fewer miles by sharing our cars, and they burn less fuel by choosing our fuel-efficient fleet. That means less traffic, less pollution, less oil dependence, and fewer headaches for all. (Not to mention more beautiful green space, room for more homes, and fewer parking lots!)</p>
